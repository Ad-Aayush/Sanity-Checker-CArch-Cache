### Computer Architecture
This is a simple sanity check to ensure that your submission format is correct. Before submitting you Lab, ensure that all the tests pass. If any test fails, re-read the lab requirements and ensure that you have followed all instructions.

### Using the tester

- For running the tester, on your submission zip file named `xy.zip`, run the following command:
  ```bash
  make path="xy.zip"
  ```
  Note that the code also checks if the zip file is named correctly. If the zip file is not named correctly, the code will not run.

- For cleaning the diff logs and the temporary files, run the following command:
  ```bash
  make clean
  ```
